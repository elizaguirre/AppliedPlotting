# AppliedPlotting

This Jupiter notebook uses advanced plotting techniques from the matplotlib Python library to answer a data science question in a visually appealing way.  

The plotted data answers the question: How have the win percentage of football rivals, Michigan Wolverines and Ohio State Buckeyes, home games in Ann Arbor, MI, and Colombus, OH, respectively, changed in the last 35 years?  

The publicly accessible datasets used in this project are from http://www.winsipedia.com/games/michigan and http://www.winsipedia.com/games/ohio-state .
